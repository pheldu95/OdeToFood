What is an enum?
What is a class?
What does defining things as public do?
What is IEnumerable? Used in List.cshtml.cs


When in a cshtml file, you can use the @ sign to transition into using c#. like if you wanted to do a for loop for example.
For OdeToFood to know what OdeToFood.Core and OdeToFood.Data are, I had to do this:
Project => AddReference => then check the references you want to add. does it automatically. now we can access things from .Core and .Data

a form with the method of get is good for doing a search. the info goes into the url

TempData

For DB
-right click on odetofood.data and manage nuget packeges. install the following
-installed Microsoft Entity Framework Core
-entityframeworkcore.sqlserver
-entityframeworkcore.design
https://www.qhmit.com/sql_server/sql_server_2017/tutorial/sql_server_2017_installation.cfm

the entity framework can create and manage a database for us. once we give it the context
OdeToFoodDbContext.cs

key topic=Migrations
-confusing
-command is: dotnet ef migrations
-what do these do?
-describes database schema/schema changes. puts code into OdeToFood/OdeToFood.csproj
-look in 20200508191151_initialcreate file. in migrations folder of OdeToFood.Data
    -shows the db schema
-dotnet ef database update --> you can update a database to a specific migration
    -dotnet ef database update -s ../OdeTofood/OdeToFood.csproj
    - this command used the migration to update the database. now there is a database
    called OdeToFood with a Restaurants table in it
-later if i want to change the db schema, i can make another migration

our connection string to connect to local db goes into appsettings.json

_Layout is in charge of organizing the ui for every page
    -scripts, css, and html that goes on every page. like a copy right at the bottom of the page
    - can use @RenderSection to create a section of the page that other pages can put content into
    - @RenderSection("footer", required: false) --> this section is not required but other pages can use it if wanted
    - Everything is rendered out in the @RenderBody section, unless you put it in a different section. like the footer for example
    - but if you put something in a different section, you must tell say so on the cshtml page using @section
    -you can also have multiple layout pages. for example, you could have a layout page just for the restaurant list view

Partial view - only renders part of your page/view at a time
    - _Summary file is an example of this. create razor page, but check the partial view box only.

ViewData - a way you can pass information to the _Layout view

ViewComponent - almost like a mini razor page. you can pass it information
    -a view component doesn't respond to a get or post request. it is kinda like a partial view
    - it is embedded into another view
    -a partial view depends on Model information coming from its parent view
    - whereas a ViewComponent can be completely independent and get its own data

You can do a lot of the functuonality we just did by adding a scaffolding of Razor Pages using ENtity Framework (CRUD)

wwwroot folder - stores libraries like jquery, and bootstrap
    -also any pictures we want to have in the app, get put in here
    -stores the css file for the whole site
    -these libraries get sourced in on the Layout page
